### Description of the project    
Predict a computer-guessed number in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?    
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Conditions of the competition:**  
- The computer generate an integer from 1 to 101, and we need to guess it. By "guess", we mean "write a program that guesses the number."
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**     
Results are evaluated by the average number of attempts and execution time at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**     
Learning to write good python code


### Stages of work on a project
Implementation of search by random generation of numbers
Reduced range random search based on whether the number is greater or less
Recursively dividing the list in half with the definition in which part of the required numberMake 

### Results:  
Your algorithm guesses the number on average in: 5.06 tries, time 0.0025 seconds


### Conclusions:  
There is no limit to perfection, there is common sense and resource constraints
